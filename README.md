# Java Cheat Sheet

This repository is for learning Java coding. It contains common syntax and explanations for various Java concepts and features.

## Project Overview

### Files Structure

- `Main.java` - Contains the main program and fundamental Java concepts
- `MethodsAndFunctions.java` - Contains methods, functions, and recursion examples
- `ArrayInJava.java` - Contains array operations and manipulations
- `ArrayString.java` - Contains String operations and methods
- `oop/` - Contains Object-Oriented Programming concepts
  - `Car.java` - Demonstrates encapsulation, constructors, and singleton pattern
  - `Student.java` - Shows static members and password validation
  - `Account.java` - Banking account example with data hiding
  - `OOP.java` - Main OOP concepts demonstration
  - `OuterClass.java` - Demonstrates nested classes

### Topics Covered

1. Primitive Data Types

   - Integer types (byte, short, int, long)

4. Control Flow

   - Conditional Statements (if, if-else, switch)
   - Loops (while, do-while, for, for-each)
   - Break and Continue
   - Labeled Statements

5. Methods and Functions

   - Method Declaration and Calling
   - Static Methods

   - Variable Arguments

6. Input/Output
   - Scanner Class
   - Console Input/Output
   - Formatting Output

## Package Structure

The project uses the `com.example` package structure following Java conventions, with sub-packages for specific concepts like OOP.
